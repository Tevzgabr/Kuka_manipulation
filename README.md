# Kuka_manipulation
This repositatori includes all the necessary code for the manipulation of the Kuka Youbot robot. 
The code is writen and designed in such a way that the robot firstly finds the marker with the id. 0 and alignes itself perpendicular to the marker at about 50 cm. Then it goes another 66 cm straight back so that all the objects on the table are visible. When the robot is in its starting position the letter Q must be pressed so that the code takes a picture, calibrates it and performs all the necessary image manipulation. When this is done the vector from the ArUco center to the contour center and the angle of the objects are send to a Simulink, where the platform and arm position are calculated. When the object is picked up the robot surches for the marker with the id. 1, where it than puts the object.
